# Material Design pure SASS

## Background
I started this project because I disliked a lot of the angular bindings for Material Design as they often require you to use their own components. I thought I would attempt to write a pure SASS/CSS Material Framework.

Bearing in mind that I am a sole developer, the naming conventions of some of the classes are less than ideal, however if you wish to fork this project and change names of classes or add functionality feel free.
