# Material Design pure SASS

## Background
I started this project because I disliked a lot of the angular bindings for Material Design as they often require you to use their own components. I thought I would attempt to write a pure SASS/CSS Material Framework.

Bearing in mind that I am a sole developer, the naming conventions of some of the classes are less than ideal, however if you wish to fork this project and change names of classes or add functionality feel free.

## Colours/Colors
Colo(u)rs in Material Design are defined on the google Material design page as Red 500 or Blue 800 e.t.c. As such I have taken another open source material colo(u)rs CSS framework which the syntax is as follows for

```HTML
<!--For changing the text colour-->
<div class=".color-<COLOUR NAME>-<SHADE>">

</div>
<!--For changing the background colour-->
<div class=".bg-<COLOUR NAME>-<SHADE>">

</div>
<!--For changing the border colour-->
<div class=".border-<COLOUR NAME>-<SHADE>">

</div>
```
